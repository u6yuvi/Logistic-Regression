# Logistic-Regression
This case study is related to targeting through telemarketing phone calls to sell long-term deposits.Within a campaign, the human agents execute phone calls to a list of clients to sell the deposit (outbound) or, if meanwhile the client calls the contact-center for any other reason, he is asked to subscribe the deposit (inbound). Thus, the result is a binary unsuccessful or successful contact. This study considers real data collected from one of the retail bank, from May 2008 to November 2010, in a total of 41188 phone contacts.  Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).
